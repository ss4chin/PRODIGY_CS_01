# Caesar Cipher

This project implements a simple Caesar Cipher for encryption and decryption using a given key. The Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet. This project provides functions to encrypt and decrypt text using a specified key.

## Features

- **Encryption**: Encrypts plaintext by shifting characters by a specified key.
- **Decryption**: Decrypts ciphertext by shifting characters back by the same key.
- **Case Insensitivity**: Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- **Non-Alphabetic Characters**: Non-alphabetic characters are not changed during encryption or decryption.
